## 3. Communication Interfaces from Architecture.md

| Interface Type | Implementation |
|----------------|---------------|
| **작업 요청 (Task Request)** | ✅ `TaskRequest` in `models/messages.py` |
| **작업 응답 (Task Response)** | ✅ `TaskResponse` in `models/messages.py` |
| **정보 요청 (Information Request)** | ✅ `InfoRequest` in `models/messages.py` |
| **상태 업데이트 (Status Update)** | ✅ `StatusUpdate` in `models/messages.py` |
| **오류 알림 (Error Notification)** | ✅ `ErrorNotification` in `models/messages.py` |
| **작업 완료 (Task Completion)** | ✅ `TaskCompletion` in `models/messages.py` |

## 4. Special Requirements from User Query

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| **심리분석 에이전트는 프롬프트 튜닝 중심** | ✅ `PromptTemplate` in `models/psychological.py` |
| **글쓰기 에이전트는 프롬프트 튜닝 중심** | ✅ `PromptTemplateLibrary` in `models/reports.py` |

## 5. Knowledge Base Structure from 지식베이스명세서.md

| Knowledge Base Component | Implementation |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| **벡터 DB 구조** | ✅ `VectorDBCollection` in `models/knowledge.py` |
| **메타데이터 스키마** | ✅ `KnowledgeChunk` with metadata fields in `models/knowledge.py` |
| **청킹 전략** | ✅ `KnowledgeBaseConfig` with chunk settings in `models/knowledge.py` |
| **검색 방법** | ✅ `SearchQuery` in `models/knowledge.py` |

## Conclusion

The implemented data models fully align with the architecture specified in `architecture.md` and incorporate the special requirements for prompt-centered approaches for the psychological and report writer agents.

All data structures, communication interfaces, and agent-specific models have been implemented as Pydantic models, ensuring type safety and validation throughout the system.
